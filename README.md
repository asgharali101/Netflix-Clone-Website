```
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

3. Run the following command to create a new project with Node.js modules:
   ```
   npm create vite@latest my-project
   ```
   This command will initialize a new project using Vite.js, a build tool for modern web development.

4. Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-project
   ```

5. Run the following command to install the dependencies and create the `node_modules` folder:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the required dependencies for your project, including Vite.js and any other packages specified in your project's `package.json` file.

6. After the dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to start the development server and view your website:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch a development server where you can preview your website in the browser. Any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

That's it! You're now ready to start developing your website using Vite.js. Happy coding!
```
